# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains standardized documentation for OctoAcme's project management practices. Use these resources to guide initiation, planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme follows a structured five-phase project lifecycle: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Close & Retrospective. The approach is built on foundational principles: customer-first prioritization, iterative delivery of small testable increments, clear ownership through designated Project Managers and Product Leads, and data-informed decision-making. During Initiation, teams validate business need and create a Project One-pager with clear objectives and metrics. Planning organizes work into shippable increments with acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done, ensuring alignment before execution.

Roles are clearly defined: Project Managers coordinate delivery, manage schedules and risks; Product Managers drive product outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Developers implement features and uphold quality; QA validates acceptance criteria. Communication is structured via daily standups, weekly syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risks are escalated from team triage up to sponsor-level for critical issues.

Execution relies on project boards and a Pull Request workflow with automated testing and peer reviews. Quality assurance is built in through unit, integration, and smoke tests, security scanning, and manual QA for acceptance. Velocity and metrics are tracked, and a Risk Register is updated weekly. Before release, criteria must be met, tests pass, and rollback plans are documented. Releases are announced and post-deploy verifications performed.

Continuous improvement is driven by retrospectives after every sprint, release, or major milestone. Teams prioritize action items and document learnings, converting feedback into actionable improvements. Project documentation (Charter, roadmap, release plan, risk register, retrospectives) is stored here and in `.copilot/` directories, ensuring equal access and context-rich guidance for all team members.
